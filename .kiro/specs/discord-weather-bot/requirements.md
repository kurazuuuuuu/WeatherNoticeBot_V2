# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Discord bot that provides weather information to users using Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) API. The bot will respond to commands, send scheduled weather updates via DM, and provide AI-generated positive messages along with weather data within Discord servers and direct messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to get current weather information for my location, so that I can quickly check weather conditions without leaving Discord.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/weather [location]` THEN the bot SHALL respond with current weather information for the specified location
2. WHEN a user types `/weather` without a location THEN the bot SHALL prompt the user to provide a location
3. WHEN the bot provides weather information THEN it SHALL include temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
4. WHEN an invalid location is provided THEN the bot SHALL respond with an error message suggesting valid location formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to get weather forecasts, so that I can plan my activities for the coming days.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/forecast [location]` THEN the bot SHALL respond with a 5-day weather forecast for the specified location
2. WHEN the forecast is displayed THEN it SHALL include daily high/low temperatures and weather conditions
3. WHEN the forecast data is unavailable THEN the bot SHALL inform the user and suggest trying again later

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to set and save my preferred location, so that I can receive personalized weather information without specifying my location each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/set-location [area]` THEN the bot SHALL save the user's preferred location to the database
2. WHEN a user uses weather commands without specifying a location THEN the bot SHALL use their saved location from the database
3. WHEN a user wants to change their location THEN the bot SHALL update their saved location in the database
4. WHEN a user has not set a location THEN the bot SHALL prompt them to set their preferred area first
5. WHEN storing user data THEN the bot SHALL ensure data privacy and security compliance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Discord server administrator, I want to configure the bot's permissions and settings, so that I can control how it operates in my server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is added to a server THEN it SHALL only respond to users with appropriate permissions
2. WHEN a server admin uses `/weather-config` THEN the bot SHALL allow configuration of default server settings
3. WHEN the bot encounters rate limits THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully and inform users of temporary unavailability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want weather alerts and notifications, so that I can be informed of severe weather conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/weather-alerts [location]` THEN the bot SHALL display any active weather alerts for that location
2. WHEN severe weather alerts are present THEN the bot SHALL highlight them with appropriate formatting and emojis
3. WHEN no alerts are active THEN the bot SHALL confirm that no weather alerts are currently in effect

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to receive scheduled weather updates via direct message, so that I can stay informed about weather conditions without having to request them manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user subscribes to weather updates THEN the bot SHALL send daily weather information to their DM at a specified time
2. WHEN sending scheduled updates THEN the bot SHALL include current weather and daily forecast for the user's registered location
3. WHEN a user wants to change their schedule THEN the bot SHALL provide commands to modify or cancel scheduled updates
4. WHEN the scheduled update fails THEN the bot SHALL retry and log the error appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to receive AI-generated positive messages with my weather information, so that I can start my day with encouragement and weather-appropriate advice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot provides weather information THEN it SHALL include an AI-generated positive message related to the weather conditions
2. WHEN generating messages THEN the bot SHALL use Google Gemini or similar AI service to create contextually appropriate and uplifting content
3. WHEN weather conditions are challenging THEN the AI message SHALL provide encouragement and practical advice
4. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the bot SHALL provide weather information with a default positive message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want the weather information to be visually appealing and easy to read, so that I can quickly understand the weather conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot responds with weather information THEN it SHALL use Discord embeds with appropriate colors and formatting
2. WHEN displaying weather conditions THEN the bot SHALL include relevant weather emojis and icons
3. WHEN showing temperature data THEN the bot SHALL display temperatures in Celsius (primary for Japan)
4. WHEN the response is too long THEN the bot SHALL format the information in multiple embeds or use pagination

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Discord user, I want to see a list of major cities available for weather queries, so that I can easily select a valid location without guessing location names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/locations` THEN the bot SHALL display a list of major Japanese cities available for weather queries
2. WHEN displaying the cities list THEN the bot SHALL organize cities by region (Kanto, Kansai, Kyushu, etc.) for better readability

4. WHEN a user selects a city from the list THEN the bot SHALL provide an easy way to use that city name in weather commands
5. WHEN the cities list is too long for a single message THEN the bot SHALL use pagination or multiple embeds to display all cities
6. WHEN displaying cities THEN the bot SHALL include both Japanese and romanized names for international users
